    <strong>VertNet portal beta version 0.0.1</strong> - We release early and often, and this is a very limited release! We have 5 collections loaded from our list of 388. Many data sets that are currently accessible from the classic networks (MaNIS, ORNIS, HerpNet, FishNet) aren't here yet. In the meantime, enjoy this early look at what we're building by experimenting with our search feature. Please expect bugs and submit feedback to help us make the portal a great tool for the community!

  <h3>What's VertNet?</h3>
  VertNet is a collaborative project that aims to make global biodiversity data open, discoverable, interoperable, mappable, and available publicly. Vertnet is funded by the National Science Foundation to address the growing technical and social challenges of the classic data portals: MaNIS, ORNIS, HerpNet, and FishNet. 

  Partners include the University of California Berkeley, the University of Colorado, Kansas University, and Tulane University, in collaboration with over 165 institutions representing 388 natural history and paleontological collections.

  The VertNet technical architecture is built on a scalable platform using Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services, Hadoop, HTML5, and the dynamic spatial visualization of CartoDB. It's all <a href="https://github.com/VertNet">open source on GitHub</a>.
  
  <h3>What's in beta 0.0.1?</h3>

  In version 0.0.1 we've loaded 5 test resources. We've surfaced a simple occurrence search feature that supports full text keyword search, and searching on the following Darwin Core terms: Genus, SpecificEpithet, Year, Country, and Institution code. Search results can be viewed in a table or on a map. Clicking on search results gives you an bookmarkable occurrence detail page with the full record contents. 

  <h3>Say Hello!</h3>
