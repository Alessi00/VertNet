    <strong>VertNet beta 0.0.2</strong> - We release early and often, and this is a very limited release! We are testing this release with a small subset from our list of hundreds of collections. Enjoy this early look at what we're building by experimenting with our search feature. Please expect bugs and submit feedback to help us make the portal a great tool for the community!

  <h3>What's VertNet?</h3>
  VertNet is a collaborative project that aims to make global biodiversity data open, discoverable, interoperable, mappable, and available publicly. Vertnet is funded by the National Science Foundation to address the growing technical and social challenges of the classic data portals: MaNIS, ORNIS, HerpNet, and FishNet. 

  Partners include the University of California Berkeley, the University of Colorado, Kansas University, and Tulane University, in collaboration with over 165 institutions representing 388 natural history and paleontological collections.

  The VertNet technical architecture is built on a scalable platform using Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services, Hadoop, HTML5, and the dynamic spatial visualization of CartoDB. It's all <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VertNet">open source on GitHub</a>.
  
  <h3>What's in beta 0.0.2?</h3>

  In version 0.0.2 we've added 11 test resources, making the current corpus of records ascend to some 177 thousand occurrences. In addition, we have added a key feature: the ability to download the result of a search. If your query returns less than 1000 records, the dataset will be available for download immediately. Otherwise, the portal will ask for an email address to which a link to the zipped file will be sent.</p>

  But that is not all! We have fixed tens of issues and bugs and deployed a lot of improvements since version 0.0.1. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vertnet/webapp/issues?labels=&page=1&state=closed">Check it out!</a>
