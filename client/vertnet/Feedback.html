    <strong>VertNet beta 0.0.2</strong> - We release early and often, and this is a very limited release! We are testing this release with only 10 collections (~177K occurrences total) from our list of 388 collections. Enjoy this early look at what we're building by experimenting with our search feature. Please expect bugs and submit feedback to help us make the portal a great tool for the community!

  <h3>Let us know what you think!</h3>
  
  We'd really love to hear from you about anything and everything, so if you have any feedback, big or small, <a href="http://form.jotform.us/form/31397097595166">please fill out the form</a> and help us build a better portal! If you'd rather <a href="https://github.com/VertNet/webapp/issues/new">submit a GitHub issue</a> instead, you can do that too. :)
